			<h2>About AURORA POSTCARDS</h2>
		
			<div class="view-window" style="background-image: url(img/postcards_002.jpg);"></div>
			<p>This is a website selling many kinds of postcards. Some of the postcards are photography, some are illustrated, and some are collage. The photography and collage are created by myself. We provides customers the opportunity to choose postcards entirely on your own preferences, not necessarily in sets, although they are in sets originally.</p>
